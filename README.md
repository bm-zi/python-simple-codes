    Open a terminal and from shell prompt run:

 (3) Enoy learning python basics interactively just
     by running this script.
     
  
  PS.
  If you find a sample code in learning python, then you can append a function with fn 
  (n- is an integer, and must be uniq in script).
  
  Then in file runnme.py add a short description with an index number matching the integer n as in file codeExamples.py
