4.
If you want to add a sample code while learning python, 
then you can append a function named as fn. 
(n- is an integer, and must be uniq in script).
  
Then in file 'list' add a short description with an index number matching the integer n as 
in file codeExamples.py. This will appear as the main menu when running script runme.py
